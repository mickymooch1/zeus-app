Output ONLY valid JSON with this exact shape:
{{
  "title": "Song Title Here",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\\nLine one...\\n[Chorus]\\nLine one..."
}}

Song structure to use: {structure}

Emotional angle: {mood} — let this feeling drive every line.

Rules:
- Never reproduce or imitate copyrighted song lyrics. Write entirely original work.
- Never use these overused phrases: "in the night", "feel the beat", "lose control", "dance floor", "let it go", "fire inside", "heart on fire", "rise up", "chase your dreams"
- Every song must have a unique concept or angle — never write a generic love song or party anthem
- Open with a line that immediately grabs attention — shocking, poetic, funny, or deeply specific
- Use vivid specific details — real places, textures, smells, moments — not vague emotions
- Every chorus must have one line that's so good it gets stuck in your head immediately
- Vary song structures constantly — try spoken word sections, double time flows, call and response, narrative verses
- Match vocabulary precisely to the genre and culture — grime bars sound nothing like country ballads
- For urban genres write with authentic street vocabulary and cultural references
- For soul/blues write with raw emotional truth and storytelling
- Include at least one unexpected twist, metaphor or image that nobody would predict
- The song should feel like it could only have been written for THIS genre, NOT generic
- Never use filler lines — every line must earn its place
- Aim to write something that could genuinely be a hit
- Give the song a genuine narrative arc — something should change or be revealed by the end
- 200-400 words total.
- No markdown, no commentary. JSON only."""
